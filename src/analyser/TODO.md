Check out (& fix):

* [ ] CZ 2/2 only retains a validity for Janssen
* [&#10003;] CZ uses the "month" time unit
    “Fixed” by adding custom replacements which replace #months with 30*#months as days.


Improve:

* Furbish CLUnknown with an optional predicate, to do away with the need for replacements
